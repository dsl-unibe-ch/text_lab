### 💬 AI Chat
Text Lab provides a secure Chat interface allowing you to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) running locally on the University cluster.
* **Privacy:** Unlike public chatbots, your conversation history and prompts are not stored or used to train external models.
* **Usage:** Use this for summarizing sensitive text, brainstorming research ideas, or drafting emails.

### 📊 Visualize Data
This tool allows you to upload datasets (CSV/Excel) and use LLMs to generate Python code for visualization.
* Describe the plot you want to see (e.g., "Show a bar chart of sales by region").
* The system generates the code and renders the plot instantly.
